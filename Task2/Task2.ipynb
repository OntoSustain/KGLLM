    "    - Familiar examples include physical properties such as length, mass, time, force, energy, power, electric charge, etc. \n",
    "    - Less familiar examples include currency, interest rate, price-to-earning ratio, and information capacity. \n",
    "    - EACH INDICATOR HAS ONLY ONE SINGLE QUANTITY KIND.\n",
    "2. Has measurement phenomenon: Relates the indicator to the environmental phenomenon measured. \n",
    "3. Has unit: Relates the indicator to the required unit derived from sustainability standards. \n",
    "    - A unit is a particular quantity value that has been chosen as a scale for measuring other quantities of the same kind (more generally of equivalent dimension). \n",
    "    - For example, the meter is a quantity of length that has been rigorously defined and standardized by the BIPM (International Board of Weights and Measures). \n",
    "    - THIS PROPERTY IS OPTIONAL. SOMETIMES THE REQUIRED UNITS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE STANDARD, BUT SOMETIMES NOT. \n",
    "4. Has applicability: Relates the indicator to its applicability status, which can be either optional (indicated by 'if applicable') or mandatory (indicated by 'shall'). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some requirements for extracted indicators and triples: \n",
    "1. If the provided text does not contain specific sustainability reporting indicators as defined by the task, return: None. \n",
